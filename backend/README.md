# Demo backend

Simple ```npm``` package to run a mock backend server with ```GraphQL```.

It leverages [json-graphql-server] to create a GraphQL API.

# Database 

The database is specified in the ```db.js``` file which has already mapped some data in ```JSON``` format.

# Usage

It's pretty simple to get started, just need to install the devDependency and run the server.

1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm run start```
